Lung-cancer-detection-using-3d-convnet
In this project the lung cancer probability is predicted using 3d-convolutional neural networks.
There are 2 jupyter notebooks and one python file are there in this repository.
Data preprocessing.ipynb contains the complete work i did for data preprocessing.
Pure tensorflow 3dconvnet.ipynb contains the complete work i did using the pure tensorflow methods.
3dconvnet.py contains the tflearn api that is used to predict the probability of a patient having cancer.
